## History of React Router and Remix

- 2014: **React-Router** created. React library that Handles routing in client apps
- 2021: **Remix** created. React framework that renders on server, based on **React-Router v6**
- 2023: **Remix v2** released. Framework improved
- 2024: **React-Router v7** released. Merges both **React-Router** and **Remix**

<hr />

- Two modes and documentation with React-Router 7:
  - **Framework** Mode (Uses a vite server or client SPA)
  - **Library** Mode (React client only)

---

## Library Mode

- Similar to previous versions of React Router
- Strictly client, no server needed
- Still relevant for:
  - Apps that migrate from V6
  - Single Page Apps
  - Offline + Sync Architectures
  - Local-first interactions

---

## Framework mode

- Could have been named "Remix v3"
- Full-stack architecture, Server Side rendering
- New: Allows pre-rendering (Static Site Generation)
- Uses Vite bundler and dev server integration (it's fast)
- Hot module replacement (dev change and keeps state)
- Code splitting (Automatic)
- Route conventions (compatible with type safety)
  - File system or config-based routing
- Data loading and Actions (compatible with type safety)
- Automatic revalidation of page data after actions (updates data on updates)
- SSR, SPA, and static rendering strategies
- APIs for pending states and optimistic UI (Spinners and Guess)
- Deployment adapters (Cloudlare, Netlify, AWS, etc)

## Layout components with React Router

<div style={{marginTop: "0px", height:"600px", overflowY:"scroll"  }}  onLoad={(e)=>(e.target.parentElement.scrollTop=105)}>

<iframe
  src='https://remix.run/_docs/routing'
  scrolling='no'
  width='100%'
  height='800'
  style={{ overflow: 'hidden' }}
/>
</div>

---

## React Router vs React Data

- In React, we use `fetch` in components
  - Must isolate in `useEffect` hook or the new `use` API.

<hr />

- With React Router, we use `Loader` (to Read) and `Action` (to Modify)
- This can be called by the router, before loading the component
- Available to the component through props or through a hook
- RR can suspend if the data is not available
